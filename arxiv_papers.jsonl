Orion uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision. Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.", "authors": ["Max Bazalii", "Marius Fleischer"], "published_date": "2025-09-18T17:52:06Z", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15195v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15195v1", "primary_category": "cs.SE", "journal_ref": null, "doi": null}
{"doc_id": "2509.15194v1", "title": "Evolving Language Models without Labels: Majority Drives Selection,   Novelty Promotes Variation", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced (variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting, highlighting its broad applicability.", "authors": ["Yujun Zhou", "Zhenwen Liang", "Haolin Liu", "Wenhao Yu", "Kishan Panaganti", "Linfeng Song", "Dian Yu", "Xiangliang Zhang", "Haitao Mi", "Dong Yu"], "published_date": "2025-09-18T17:50:04Z", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15194v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15194v1", "primary_category": "cs.LG", "journal_ref": null, "doi": null}
