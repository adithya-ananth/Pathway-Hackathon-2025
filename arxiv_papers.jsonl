{"doc_id": "2509.18054v1", "title": "A Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for   Algorithm Selection in the Facility Layout Problem", "abstract": "Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an NP-hard optimization problem with a multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm depends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a new recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To address this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published literature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to gather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct approaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based search, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with data-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a commercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a series of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy and reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better than the commercial LLM chatbot.", "authors": ["Nikhil N S", "Amol Dilip Joshi", "Bilal Muhammed", "Soban Babu"], "published_date": "2025-09-22T17:29:10Z", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18054v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18054v1", "primary_category": "cs.IR"}
{"doc_id": "2509.17671v1", "title": "Turk-LettuceDetect: A Hallucination Detection Models for Turkish RAG   Applications", "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hindered by their tendency to hallucinate, generating plausible but factually incorrect information. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems attempt to address this issue by grounding responses in external knowledge, hallucination remains a persistent challenge, particularly for morphologically complex, low-resource languages like Turkish. This paper introduces Turk-LettuceDetect, the first suite of hallucination detection models specifically designed for Turkish RAG applications. Building on the LettuceDetect framework, we formulate hallucination detection as a token-level classification task and fine-tune three distinct encoder architectures: a Turkish-specific ModernBERT, TurkEmbed4STS, and multilingual EuroBERT. These models were trained on a machine-translated version of the RAGTruth benchmark dataset containing 17,790 instances across question answering, data-to-text generation, and summarization tasks. Our experimental results show that the ModernBERT-based model achieves an F1-score of 0.7266 on the complete test set, with particularly strong performance on structured tasks. The models maintain computational efficiency while supporting long contexts up to 8,192 tokens, making them suitable for real-time deployment. Comparative analysis reveals that while state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate high recall, they suffer from low precision due to over-generation of hallucinated content, underscoring the necessity of specialized detection mechanisms. By releasing our models and translated dataset, this work addresses a critical gap in multilingual NLP and establishes a foundation for developing more reliable and trustworthy AI applications for Turkish and other languages.", "authors": ["Selva Ta\u015f", "Mahmut El Huseyni", "\u00d6zay Ezerceli", "Reyhan Bayraktar", "Fatma Bet\u00fcl Terzio\u011flu"], "published_date": "2025-09-22T12:14:11Z", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17671v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17671v1", "primary_category": "cs.CL"}

However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible design.", "authors": ["Juan Ca\u00f1ada", "Ra\u00fal Alonso", "Julio Molleda", "Fidel D\u00edez"], "published_date": "2025-09-22T09:02:53Z", "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17544v1", "pdf_url": "http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17544v1", "primary_category": "cs.AI"}
